    "# An Additional Lecture on Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling methods in machine learning play a crucial role in ensuring that the data used for training, validation, and testing are representative of the underlying population. Let's delve into some common types of sampling techniques used in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Sampling**:\n",
    "   - Random sampling involves selecting a subset of data points from the entire dataset without any specific pattern or bias. \n",
    "   - Mathematically, each data point has an equal probability of being chosen.\n",
    "   - Random sampling is widely used when the dataset is large and uniformly distributed, ensuring that each sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Systematic Sampling**:\n",
    "   - Systematic sampling involves selecting data points at regular intervals from an ordered list of the population.\n",
    "   - The interval, also known as the sampling interval, is determined by dividing the total population size by the desired sample size.\n",
    "   - This method is efficient and straightforward but can introduce bias if there is an underlying pattern in the ordering of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stratified Sampling**:\n",
    "   - In stratified sampling, the dataset is divided into several homogeneous subgroups called strata based on certain characteristics.\n",
    "   - Samples are then randomly selected from each stratum proportionally to their size in the population.\n",
    "   - This technique ensures that each subgroup is represented adequately in the sample, which is crucial when certain subgroups are underrepresented in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cluster Sampling**:\n",
    "   - Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters or groups and then randomly selecting entire clusters to be included in the sample.\n",
    "   - This method is particularly useful when it is impractical or expensive to sample individuals directly.\n",
    "   - However, cluster sampling can introduce bias if the clusters are not representative of the population or if there is heterogeneity within clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Stratified Cluster Sampling**:\n",
    "   - This method combines the principles of stratified and cluster sampling by first dividing the population into strata and then selecting clusters within each stratum.\n",
    "   - It aims to capture the variability within strata while also accounting for the efficiency gained through cluster sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sampling method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice of method depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, the research objectives, and resource constraints. Understanding these sampling techniques is crucial for ensuring the reliability and generalizability of machine learning models."

    "## Random Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary random sampling, also known as simple random sampling, is one of the most straightforward and commonly used sampling techniques. In this method, each data point in the population has an equal probability of being selected, independently of other data points. This ensures that every possible sample of a given size has an equal chance of being selected, making the sample representative of the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary random sampling is useful when the population is homogeneous, and there is no need for additional stratification or clustering. It is straightforward to implement and provides an unbiased representation of the population. However, it may not be suitable for datasets with specific characteristics, such as stratified or clustered populations, where other sampling methods like stratified or cluster sampling may be more appropriate."

    "## Systematic Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Systematic sampling is a method of selecting data points from a population at regular intervals. In the context of time series data, systematic sampling involves selecting every kth data point from the time series, where k is the sampling interval. This method ensures that the selected samples are spread evenly across the entire time series, allowing for efficient and representative sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a time series dataset with timestamps as index. Let's create a sample time series dataset for demonstration. Then we will use a sampling interval of length 3, i.e. we will use every 3rd data point."
