    "The [Newton-Raphson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) is an iterative algorithm to find roots of a function. The main idea is to find successively better approximations to the roots. In order to find the roots, the algorithm starts with a random guess and then using the tangent line to the graph gets a better approximation. Then we repeat the procedure until we get a good-enough solution.\n",

    "While perceptrons are limited in their ability to learn complex non-linear relationships, they can be combined into more sophisticated architectures called [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). Another way of saying would be a neural network is a directed computation graph of perceptions:\n",

    "Neural networks are composed of multiple layers of interconnected perceptrons. Thus their weights form a sequence of matrices (a tensor) $(w^i_{j,k})$.  In the feedforward phase of the network,  where the input $(x^i_j)$ at some layer $i$ is processed by the network as\n",

Again, as in the case of perceptron, when we get the output from the output layer, we calculate the error and then propagate the error back updating weights iteratively. This procedure is a variation of the gradient descent algorithm we outlined above.\n",
