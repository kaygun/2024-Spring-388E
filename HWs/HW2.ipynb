    "- Refrain from saving datasets locally. You may experiment with your answers on a locally saved version of the datasets, but do not upload your local files with your homework as the datasets are very large. In your submitted answers datasets should be read from the original source URL.\n",
    "- Document all of your steps by writing appropriate markdown cells in your notebook. Refrain from using code comments to explain what has been done.\n",
    "- Avoid duplicating code. Do not copy and paste code from one cell to another. If copying and pasting is necessary, write a suitable function for the task at hand and call that function.\n",
    "- Document your use of LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Code Pilot etc). Either take screenshots of your steps and include them with this notebook, or give me a full log (both questions and answers) in a markdown file named HW2-LLM-LOG.md.\n",
