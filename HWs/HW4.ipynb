    "## Overall Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not upload data files with your homework since the datasets are large and already available as a library. \n",
    "- Document all of your steps by writing appropriate markdown cells in your notebook. Refrain from using code comments to explain what has been done.\n",
    "- Avoid duplicating code. Do not copy and paste code from one cell to another. If copying and pasting is necessary, write a suitable function for the task at hand and call that function.\n",
    "- Document your use of LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Code Pilot etc). Either take screenshots of your steps and include them with this notebook, or give me a full log (both questions and answers) in a markdown file named HW4-LLM-LOG.md.\n",

    "Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in a 25-point deduction for each infraction.\n",

    "Your task is to find the best supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts the target variables from the independent variables. You must test **all** of the supervised classification algorithms we learned in this class on both datasets. \n",

    "- In train-test-split phase, you must use an appropriate stratification method. \n",
    "- In testing the algorithms, you must use an appropriate cross-validation method that gives accuracy/precision/recall with a confidence interval. Do not trust the default setting on cross-validation functions. Find the correct way of stratifying the dataset.\n",
    "- In testing the ensemble algorithms, you must test both ensemble schemes (one-vs-one and one-vs-rest) in your cross-validation methods.\n",
    "- In testing all algorithms, record how long it takes to run the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do your experiments, and display your results (accuracy/precision/recall/runtime with the confidence intervals) as a table. Decide which algorithm is your choice for each dataset. Write a detailed analysis of the results displayed in the table. In your analyses, I would like to see why you have chosen *your best model*."
